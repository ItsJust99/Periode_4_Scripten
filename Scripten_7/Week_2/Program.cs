              *    How are you going to tackle the individual parts?   
              *    Try to create a simple class diagram to describe what your class needs to have
              *    (you can find an example in the Week_2.1_OOP_Revisited project folder)
              *

              *     - Attack : the hero does 2D6 damage
              *     - Flee : when hit points are below 50% the monster has a chance to flee on it's turn

              *  - Prepare for the final assignment next week
              *     - Practice using the Hero and Monster classes
              *       - Create default and custom objects
